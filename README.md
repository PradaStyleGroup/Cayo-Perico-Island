# Cayo-Perico-Island

A complete adjustment has been made to Cayo Perico Island. This was done with the aim of improving performance and enhancing the experience for servers that enjoy using this map.

Content available in the resource;

- IPL code required for correct island activation.
- Visual map for all server users with LODs.
- Central warehouse door adjusted. [Removed door with Limbo]
- Water correctly loaded without exception of waves over the island.

# IMPORTANT

If you have the island's IPL being loaded in the iplloader.lua file in your database, simply remove the entire island code and keep only the download resource.
